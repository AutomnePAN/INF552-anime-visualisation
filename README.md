# INF552-anime-visualisation

The project of course INF552 of Polytechnique,

During this project of data visualisation we want to work with some of the datasets in https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/top-25-anime-manga-and-video-game-datasets/. 

We will principally be working on this data set https://www.kaggle.com/canggih/anime-data-score-staff-synopsis-and-genre?select=dataanime.csv, 
to study and present the relations between the popularities, scores, and other features, like the genres, the ranking, the staffs, etc.  
If possible, we will also use some information given by the other data sets in the link, for example, the specific score from each user, to study how different genre of animes gain their popularities in different types of audiences. 

## Task I

## Task II
